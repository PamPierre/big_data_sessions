********* Practical Session 1: Datamining For Big Data *************************
********************************************************************************

You need to complete this file with your answers and upload it in the "M2
CS Big data (BIG DATA)" course on Claroline connect.

Do not modify or remove lines starting with stars "****". I use them to extract your name and answers.
Write your answers only between lines "******* answer X.X" and "******* end answer X.X".

****** Fill in your name on the next line  (do not modify or remove this line)

****** end name (do not modify or remove this line)


The aim of this session is to practice with the spark framework.
You will use the interactive pyspark shell.

****************************************************
****** TODO
****************************************************
When you unzip session1.zip, this create a directory Practical_Session_1 in which you will find
the 'session1.txt' file and a data/ directory containing several example data files.

To start this practical session, you should:
1- open this file 'session1.txt' with a text editor to be able to write your answers in it.
2- prepare to start the pyspark shell in the terminal:
  A- If you use your own computer where you have installed spark:
     - start a terminal in the directory where you have unzipped session1.zip
     - go to step 4-.

  B- If you have not installed spark on your computer: use a computer of the university:
    - In this case you have to connect to the computer mira2.univ-st-etienne.fr using the ssh command.
      In a terminal, type (replace your_login with your university login):
      ssh your_login@mira2.univ-st-etienne.fr
      (it will ask for your password)
      Then you are connected to mira2.
    - From there, you have to copy the session1.zip in your home directory of the university if you have not done it yet:
      cp /home/jeudbapt/big_data/session1.zip .
    - then unzip it:
      unzip session1.zip
    - then cd into the extracted directory : 
      cd Practical_Session_1

4- Now, you can start the pyspark shell:
 (This command works for those that use the university computers,
 if you have your own installation of Spark, the path to pyspark binary will be different).

 export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3
 /home/jeudbapt/local/spark-3.0.1-bin-hadoop2.7/bin/pyspark --master local[2]

5- Then to try the pyspark shell, type (in the pyspark shell):
sc.parallelize(range(50)).collect()
 It should output the list [1,2,3,....,49]. Otherwise, pyspark is not working.

 In case of error, it may be necessary to type:
 export SPARK_LOCAL_IP=127.0.0.1
 in the terminal before launching pyspark.

 remarks: 

   The "--master local[4]" option means that spark is started on the local machine on 4 cores.
   By default, the pyspark shell may use python version 2.7. The line:
   export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python3
   is to use python3.

   To set the log level (for the messages displayed by pyspark), you can type
   (in the pyspark shell) :
     sc.setLogLevel("WARN")
   valid log levels include: ALL, DEBUG, ERROR, FATAL, INFO, OFF, TRACE, WARN


6- Except for the questions of part I, you should copy in this file the code that you type in the
   interactive shell.

7- At the end of the session, upload this file session1.txt on claroline connect (BIG DATA course).

8- If you have not finished at the end of the session, you can continue at home and upload another version
   later (but in this case, do not remove your first version).

***************  Some documentation:
********************************************************************************

 You will use Spark version 2.3 or higher.

 These versions provide another data structure (DataFrames) in addition to
 RDDs, but you will use RDD (RDD are less powerful but simpler).

 The Quick Start guide for Spark version >2.1 is mainly focused on
 DataFrames and not RDDs.
 Therefore, you will use the Quick start guide of version 2.0.

 The Spark start page (version 2.0):
 http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/quick-start.html

 Python 3 tutorial:
 https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html
 In the tutorial, each example is available in several languages (scala, python,...).
 You have to select the python version.

 Spark documentation on RDDs:
   http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html
  the available Spark operations on RDDs:
  - transformations:
    http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#transformations
  - actions:
    http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#actions

********************************************************************************
*****************  Part I
********************************************************************************

1) Go on the quick start page of version 2.0:
http://spark.apache.org/docs/2.0.0/quick-start.html
Do the "Basic" part on the "lotr.txt" text file (this text file is in data directory of the zip file).
(For the filter transformation, use the word "Bilbo" instead of "Spark")

2) Do the "more on RDD" operations using again the "lotr.txt" text file.


********************************************************************************
************************* IMPORTANT ******************************************** 
********************************************************************************

For the next questions, you have to copy in this file the code that you
type in the interactive shell between the lines "******* answer x.x" and
"******* end answer x.x".  Do not modify or remove these two lines (they
are used to automatically extract your answers).
********************************************************************************


********************************************************************************
******************  Part II
********************************************************************************

For these questions, you will need the following operations on RDD
(see the documentations on RDD, the links are above).
- map
- flatmap
- reduceByKey
- filter
- take
- collect
- sortBy

The file products.txt  contains a list of products.
Each line of this file is:
TID product_name price category

1) Generate a RDD named "prod" of tuples (tid, name, price, category) from this text file.
   The "tid" should be an integer and price a float. You can use the function int() to convert a string to an integer (e.g., int("12") is 12) and float() to convert to a float.
   This RDD will contain tuples like (1, "apple", 3.3, "fruit") ...
******* answer 2.1: do not modify or remove this line
   Replace by your answer
   prod = product.map(lambda line: (line.split())).map(lambda line:(int(line[0]) , line[1], float(line[2]), line[3]))

******* end answer 2.1: do not modify or remove this line

This "product" RDD will be the input RDD for all the following questions.

2) Generate a RDD "prod20" with all products with price > 20.
******* answer 2.2
   Replace by your answer
   prod20=prod.filter(lambda line: line[2]>20)
******* end answer 2.2

3) Sort the RDD of previous question by ascending prices. You can use the sortBy() transformation. The parameter of sortBy() is a function used to sort the RDD. For instance, if rdd contains tuples t=(t[0], t[1],...),
rdd.sortBy(lambda t: t[1]) will sort according to the ascending value of t[1] while
rdd.sortBy(lambda t: t[1]+t[2], ascending=False) will sort according to the descending value of t[1]+t[2].
******* answer 2.3
   Replace by your answer
   prod20=prod.filter(lambda price: price[2]>20).sortBy(lambda price: price[2], ascending=True)
******* end answer 2.3


4) Generate a RDD "maxpricebycat" with the maximum price for each category of product.
The result RDD will contain pairs like ("film", 42.9); ("beverage",15.0)...
******* answer 2.4
   Replace by your answer
   def max(a,b):
...     if(a>b):
...             return a
...     else:
...             return b
... 

maxcatbyprice = prod.map(lambda line: (line[3],line[2])).reduceByKey(max)

******* end answer 2.4


5) Generate a RDD "countbycat" with the number of products in each category
******* answer 2.5
   Replace by your answer
   countbycat = prod.map(lambda line :(line[3], 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b : a+b)
******* end answer 2.5

We want a RDD with the average price of products in each category (eg, ("fruit", 7.63) ...)
You will do it first in a wrong way using a reduce function avg() which is not associative :
def avg(a,b):
   return 0.5*(a+b)
6) Generate (an incorrect) RDD using this "avg" function for the reduce. Check that the result are actually incorrect.
******* answer 2.6
   Replace by your answer
   avgbycat = prod.map(lambda line: (line[3],line[2])).reduceByKey(avg)
******* end answer 2.6

7) Before doing the reduce with "avg" in the previous function, sort the RDD by increasing prices using sortby()
   Check that the results are still incorrect and different from those of question 5.
   Do the same by sorting by decreasing prices, and check the results are again different from the two previous ones.
******* answer 2.7
   Replace by your answer
   avgbycat = prod.map(lambda line: (line[3],line[2])).sortBy(lambda price:price[1]).reduceByKey(avg)
******* end answer 2.7


So, as we have seen in course, using a non-associative function gives
incorrect results and the results depends on the order of the elements in
the RDD.

8) Generate a RDD "avg_price" with the (correct) average price of products in each category.
As in the course, you can for instance
 - fist compute a rdd of (category, (sum_of_price, nb_of_product))
 - or use a weighted average function
******* answer 2.8
   Replace by your answer
	pricebycat = prod.map(lambda line :(line[3], (line[2],1))).sortByKey(False)
	pricebycat = pricebycat.reduceByKey(lambda x, y: (x[0]+y[0], x[1] + y[1]))
	avg_price = pricebycat.map(lambda line : (line[0], (line[1][0]/line[1][1])))
	avg_price.collect()
******* end answer 2.8


********************************************************************************
*************** Part III
********************************************************************************
In this part, you may also need operations union(), distinct() and intersection().


 In this part you will use the files A.txt and B.txt that are
 sets/multisets of integers (one integer per line).  The aim of this part
 is to compute operations (union, intersection,...) on sets or multi-sets
 using Spark.

 The result RDD for each question must be a list of integers.

 In questions 1 and 2, we consider that we are working on sets.
 This means that each element should appear at most once in the result.
file_A= sc.textFile("A.txt")
file_B= sc.textFile("B.txt")
file_A = file_A.map(lambda l: int(l))
file_B = file_B.map(lambda l: int(l))

1) Compute the union of A and B (First, you need to build RDDs for sets A
   and B)
******* answer 3.1
   Replace by your answer
   file_union = file_A.union(file_B).map(lambda line:int(line))
file_union.collect()
******* end answer 3.1

2) Compute the intersection of A and B:
******* answer 3.2
   Replace by your answer
   file_intersection = file_A.intersection(file_B).map(lambda line:int(line))
file_intersection.collect()
******* end answer 3.2


 We can define all these operations on multisets also. A multiset is a set
 where an element can appears several times.

3) Union (if an element appear a times in A and b times in B, it must
   appear a+b times in the union)
******* answer 3.3
   Replace by your answer
   file_union_bis = file_A.map(lambda line: (line, 1)).union(file_B.map(lambda line: (line, 1)))
   file_union_bis = file_union_bis.map(lambda line: (line[0],1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b : a+b)
   file_union_bis.collect()
******* end answer 3.3


For the following, it may be interesting to buid an intermediate RDD "sets"
that contains elements of the form (el, (a,b)) where "el" is an element of
the multi-set, "a" its number of occurrences in A and "b" its number of
occurrences in B. For instance, it will contain (1, (2, 5)) meaning that
"1" appears 2 times in A and 5 times in B.

And then, compute the result RDD of the following questions from "sets"
RDDs.

file_A_reduce = file_A.map(lambda line: (line, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b : a+b)
file_B_reduce = file_B.map(lambda line: (line, 1)).reduceByKey(lambda a,b : a+b)
def clean(line):
    if(line[1][0] is None):
        line = (line[0], (0, line[1][1]))
    if(line[1][1] is None):
        line = (line[0], (line[1][0],0))
    return line

file_join = file_A_reduce.rightOuterJoin(file_B_reduce).union(file_A_reduce.leftOuterJoin(file_B_reduce))
file_join = file_join.map(clean).reduceByKey(lambda a,b: a)

4) Intersection (if an element appear a times in A and b times in B, it
   must appear min(a,b) times in the intersection). 
   def minim(a,b):
    return min(a,b)
    
   def nTimes(line):
    times = []
    for i in range(line[1]):
        times.append(line[0])
    return times
******* answer 3.4
file_intersect = file_join.map(lambda line: (line[0], minim(line[1][0], line [1][1])))
file_intersect = file_intersect.filter(lambda line: line[1]!=0)
file_intersect.collect()
******* end answer 3.4


5) Difference (if an element appear a times in A and b times in B, it must
   appear max(0,a-b) times in the difference)
  def maxim(a, b):
    return max(0,abs(a-b))
******* answer 3.5
file_dif = file_join.map(lambda line: (line[0], maxim(line[1][0], line [1][1])))
file_dif = file_dif.filter(lambda line: line[1]!=0)
file_dif = file_intersect.filter(lambda line: line[1]!=0).flatMap(nTimes)
******* end answer 3.5

def symDif(a,b):
    return abs(max(a,b)-min(a,b))
    
6) Symmetric difference (if an element appear a times in A and b times in
   B, it must appear max(a,b) - min(a,b) in the symmetric difference)
******* answer 3.6
   file_sym = file_join.map(lambda line: (line[0], symDif(line[1][0], line [1][1])))
   file_sym = file_sym.filter(lambda line: line[1]!=0)
   file_sym = file_sym.filter(lambda line: line[1]!=0).flatMap(nTimes)
******* end answer 3.6
